/**
 * Retrieves the certificate from the smart card.
 *
 * This method retrieves the certificate from the smart card by executing a series of commands on the provided card channel.
 * It first selects the application with the specified Application Identifier (AID) using the select method of HealthCardCommand.
 * Then, it selects the file with the specified File Identifier (FID) using the select method of HealthCardCommand.
 * It retrieves the certificate data by reading the data bytes from the smart card in multiple iterations until all data is read.
 * The retrieved data is stored in a buffer.
 * Finally, the data in the buffer is converted to a byte array and returned as the certificate.
 *
 * @return The certificate as a byte array.
 * @throws IllegalStateException if the certificate couldn't be read.
