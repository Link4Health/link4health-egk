    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Existing libraries for Android are unfortunately outdated. The commonly referenced repository is <a href="https://github.com/gematik/E-Rezept-App-Android">E-Rezept-App-Android</a> by the E-Rezept App.</p>
<p>Currently, communication with the eGK via NFC relies partially on code from the E-Rezept App. To address this, sections of the E-Rezept App’s code have been extracted and repurposed into this Android library. This is intended to enhance functionality and usability for CardLink applications.</p>
<p>The source code contained in this library aims to offer a robust solution by combining the traditional code base with relevant, up-to-date counterparts to maintain compatibility and extend support. We trust this library will be of great assistance in your Android development projects involving CardLink and the eGK.</p>

<p>At the moment is not available over Maven Central, you can use the composite build feature from Gradle or build the library as aar To provide the link4health-eGK-library to your mavenLocal repository, you must run these Gradle tasks:</p>
<p>Run this task first:</p>
<p><code>./gradlew assembleRelease</code></p>
<p>Run this task second:</p>
<p><code>./gradlew publishLink4HealthEgkLibraryPublicationToMavenLocal</code></p>

<h3 id="versioning">Versioning</h3>
<p>This library adheres to Semantic Versioning (SemVer) standards. Version numbers are structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Each element increases numerically based on the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MAJOR:</strong> Introduces breaking changes, meaning that developers may need to alter their existing applications to ensure compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MINOR:</strong> Adds new features but remains backward-compatible. New additions won’t disrupt existing functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PATCH:</strong> Implements backward-compatible bug fixes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Every version release is documented thoroughly, with details regarding the features and fixes it includes.</p>
<p>When following SemVer principles, you should feel safe updating the SDK to any minor or patch version. This is because under SemVer, newer versions will not break your existing applications. All updates are carried out in a way that maintains the system’s predictability and adherence to Semantic Versioning standards.</p>
